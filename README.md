Statistical analysis for experiments carried out to investigate mechanistic causes of nestmate recognition in single-piece nesting termites.

The 'models' files contain code for setting up and running models in brms (BÃ¼rkner, 2017; 2018; 2021). The 'analysis' files contain code for making inferences from these models including finding Bayes factors and HDIs.
